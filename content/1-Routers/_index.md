#### Routers
To route data from one place to another, we need to make routing decisions. That is, someone needs to program how data is transferred from point A to point B.

You can imagine how data could take multiple paths from point A and point B, such that when a router is congested, data can flow through another path. Packets of data are transferred from one router to another, from one computer to another.

#### TCP/IP
TCP/IP are two protocols that allow computers to transfer data between them over the internet.

***IP*** or internet protocol is a way by which computers can identify one another across the internet. Every computer has a unique address in the world. Addresses are in this form:
```bash
  #.#.#.#
```
Numbers range from 0 to 255. IP addresses are 32-bits, meaning that these addresses could accommodate over 4 billion addresses. Newer versions of IP addresse, implementing 128-bits, can accommodate far more computers!
In the real world, servers do a lot of work for us.
Packets are standardized. The source and destination are held within each packet.

***TCP***, or transmission control protocol, is used to distinguish web services from one another. For example, 80 is used to denote HTTP and 443 is used to denote HTTPS. These numbers are port numbers.

When information is sent from one location to another, a source IP address, a destination IP address, and TCP port number are sent.

These protocols are also used to fragment large files into multiple parts or packets. For example, a large photo of a cat can be sent in multiple packets. When a packet is lost, TCP/IP can request missing packets again from the origin server.
TCP will acknowledge when all the data has been transmitted and received.

#### DNS
It would be very tedious if you needed to remember an IP address to visit a website.

***DNS***, or domain name systems, is a collection of servers on the internet that are used to route website addresses like harvard.edu to a specific IP address.

DNS simply hold a table or database that links specific, fully qualified domain names to specific IP addresses.

#### HTTP
***HTTP*** or hypertext transfer protocol is an application-level protocol that developers use to build powerful and useful things through the transferring of data from one place to another.

When you see an address such as https://www.example.com you are actually implicitly visiting that address with a `/` at the end of it.

The path is what exists after that slash. For example, https://www.example.com/folder/file.html visits example.com and browses to the folder folder and then visits the file named `file.html`.

The `.com` is called a top-level domain that is used to denote the location or type of organization associated with this address.

`https` in this address is the protocol that is used to connect to that web address. By protocol, we mean that HTTP utilizes `GET` or `POST` requests to ask for information from a server. 

For example, you can launch Google Chrome, right-click, and click inspect. When you open the developer tools and visit Network, selecting Preserve log, you will see Request Headers. Youâ€™ll see mentions of `GET`. This is possible in other browsers as well, using slightly different methods.
For example, when issuing a `GET` request, your computer may send the following to a server:
```
  GET / HTTP/2
  Host: www.harvard.edu
```
Notice that this requests via HTTP the content served on www.harvard.edu

Generally, after making a request a server, you will receive the following in Response Headers:
```
  HTTP/2 200
  Content-Type: text/html
```
This approach to inspecting these logs may be a bit more complicated than need be. You can analyze the work of HTTP protocols at cs50.dev. For example, type the following in your terminal window:
```bash
  curl -I https://www.harvard.edu/
```
Notice that the output of this command returns all the header values of the responses of the server.

Via developer tools in your web browser, you can see all the HTTP requests when browsing to the above website.
Further, execute the following command in your terminal window:
```bash
  curl -I https://harvard.edu
```
Notice that you will see a 301 response, providing a hint to a browser of where it can find the correct website.

Similarly, execute the following in your terminal window:
```bash
  curl -I http://www.harvard.edu/
```
Notice that the s in https has been removed. The server response will show that the response is 301, meaning that the website has permanently moved.


Similar to 301, a code of 404 means that a specified URL has not been found. There are numerous other response codes, such as:
```
  200 OK
  301 Moved Permanently
  302 Found
  304 Not Modified
  304 Temporary Redirect
  401 Unauthorized
  403 Forbidden
  404 Not Found
  418 I'm a Teapot
  500 Internal Server Error
  503 Service Unavailable
```
